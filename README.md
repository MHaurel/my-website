## Description

Hi there, here is my portfolio website. This is still the development version of it and I try to be exhausive regarding my skills, my goals/dreams and my education.
This website will be improved all the time by adding some animations, effects or remodelings of the UI/UX in general.
For the 1st version I'd like to have a simple but yet expicit resource to present myself.

Hope my portfolio will catch your eyes because I maybe worth it ðŸ˜‰
