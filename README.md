## Description

Hi there, here is my portfolio website. This is still the development version of it and I try to be exhausive regarding my skills, my goals/dreams and my education.
This website will be improved all the time by adding some animations, effects or remodelings of the UI/UX in general.
For the 1st version I'd like to have a simple but yet explicit resource to present myself.

Hope my portfolio will catch your eyes because I maybe worth it ðŸ˜‰

- v1 : Publishing website with most important information
- v2 : Make a french version
- v3 : Add some animations and animated images and develop a more elaborate color palette
